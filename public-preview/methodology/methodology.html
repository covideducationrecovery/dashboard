      <h2>Methodology</h2>
      <p>
        This tracker displays data for more than 200 countries and territories across the globe. (See <a
          href="disclaimer">Disclaimer</a> for
        additional information about the term “country.”)
      </p>
      <p>
        Each partner was assigned a portfolio of countries for which to collect data through country representatives, as
        well as publicly available data sources. Information from publicly available sources was obtained from
        departments/ministries of education, health, state-sponsored COVID-19 dedicated websites, and news sources. Any
        news source was verified with at least one additional secondary source. The tracker reflects the most currently
        available data at the time of each round of survey completion.
